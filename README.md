# Push_Swap
Push Swap is the third project of algorithm branch in the study program at School 42 (UNIT Factory).

The main goal is to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

```
or

```shell
ARGS="..."; ./push_swap $ARGS
```
